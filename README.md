# frontend-challenge

The front-end challenge involved the creation of a specific page from the ongoing BusyBus concept in the Fundamentals track.

This screen was the bus schedule, designed to show the current location, route, and next arrival times for a number of busses. It
also segmented them according to current status, and utilized media queries for multiple viewports as well as flex.
